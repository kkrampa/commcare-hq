    Instant saving can make for a better user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    HQ has a custom component for inline editing, based on
    <a href='https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html' target='_blank'>Knockout Components</a>.
    This component is visually lighter weight than a standard text box, and it upates the value immediately via
    an ajax call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because most of HQ does not use instant saving, don't use this component near or inside of another form.
    It works well when it's the only style of saving on the page, or when it's clearly separated from other
    forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    This component has a number of options that affect the save action and the look and feel; see
